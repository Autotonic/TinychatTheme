## [**ðŸ¢‚ CLICK HERE TO INSTALL! ðŸ¢€**](https://github.com/Technetium1/TinychatTheme/raw/master/theme.user.js)

### :exclamation::no_entry_sign: **NOT** compatible with **ANY** other Tinychat userscripts.

---

* Developed on Chrome, working on Firefox, and Opera[*see note*]
* Requires [**Tampermonkey from the Chrome Web Store**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
* You can add `?notheme` at the end of the room's URL to load without applying the script:
  * [https://tinychat.com/room/tech?notheme](https://tinychat.com/room/tech?notheme)
* **OPERA NOTE:** Opera requires a [**different version of Tampermonkey**](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/), currently there are issues with Tinychat on Opera, as it's an unsupported browser, but it seems to be issues with the browser itself, not this script.
* Firefox on Android is ***COMPLETELY UNTESTED!*** Not for the average user, [**but not impossible**](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/wiki/1.6-Firefox-Android)!
