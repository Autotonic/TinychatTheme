# Tech's Tinychat Theme
---

* Only tested on Chrome, but should work on Firefox.
* Requires [**Tampermonkey**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
* You can use ?notheme at the end of the room's name to load without applying this script:
`https://tinychat.com/room/roomname?notheme`
